    <h2>What will be true when this rock is done:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A web-based sales dashboard is deployed and accessible to all sales team members and leadership; it loads quickly and is mobile-friendly</li>
        <li>Reps can view their own performance plus team and company totals; leadership can see rolled-up views with drill-through to individual rep level</li>
        <li>Dashboard data syncs from HubSpot and Halo at least every hour</li>
        <li>Dashboard displays, for each service type:
            <ul>
                <li>Goal for the period</li>
                <li>Actual Net Revenue (aka gross margin) or MRR so far for the period</li>
                <li>Sales forecast for the period (e.g. what else will close)</li>
                <li>Gap between goal and actual; gap between goal and actual+forecast</li>
                <li>Drill through to see actual opps closed, forecasted opps; also other opps that are expected to close just outside the period (e.g. we are looking at first quarter but some opps are supposed to close in April—can they be moved in?)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>All users have been trained, and sales team uses the dashboard as the primary source for pipeline visibility; manual spreadsheet reports and manual tracking are retired</li>
        <li>In sales meetings, pipeline questions are answered from the dashboard in real-time—no "I don't know" or "have to get back to you"</li>
        <li>Dashboard highlights deals with close dates in the past or missing close dates, making stale opportunities visible</li>
        <li>Funnel stage conversion rates are displayed, making it clear where deals are getting stuck</li>
        <li>All sales opportunities have been reviewed and updated with realistic close dates</li>
        <li>Dashboard data has been validated against source systems (HubSpot and Halo) to confirm accuracy</li>
        <li>Sales team has provided input on dashboard design and confirmed it meets their needs</li>
        <li>Goals are entered and maintained in a defined location that feeds the dashboard</li>
    </ul>
